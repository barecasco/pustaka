# Brief History of Spark

Spark started in 2009 as a research project in the UC Berkeley RAD Lab, later to become the AMPLab. The researchers in the lab had previ-ously been working on Hadoop MapReduce,  and observed  that MapReduce was inefficient for iterative and interactive computing jobs. Thus, from the beginning, Spark was designed to be fast for inter-active queries and iterative algorithms, bringing ideas like support for in-memory storage and efficient fault recovery.

At the inception research papers were published about Spark with 10-20x faster than MapReduce for certain jobs.

Some of the Sparkâ€™s first users were other groups inside UC Berkeley, including Machine Learning researchers such as the Mobile Millenium project, which used Spark to monitor and predict traffic congestion in the San Fransisco Bay Area. In a very short time, however, many ex-ternal organizations began using Spark, and today, over 50 organizations list themselves on the Spark PoweredBy page, and dozens speak about their use cases at Spark community events such as Spark Meetups and the Spark Summit. In addition to UC Berkeley, major contributors to Spark include Databricks, Yahoo and Intel.

In 2011, the AMPLab started to develop higher level components on Spark, such as Shark (Hive on Spark) and Spark Streaming.These and other components are sometimes referred to as the Berkeley Data Ana-lytics Stack (BDAS).

Spark was first open sourced in March 2010 and was transferred to the **Apache Software Foundation** in June 2013, where it is now a top-level project.
